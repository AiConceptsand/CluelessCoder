I have no idea what I am doing. Jumping in the water, figuring out the swimming part later

any help, from anyone, greatly appreciated. back in my day we used notepad. no seriously we did. there was no java, or even google. Been away a long time. wayback machine gms1.com (because was not paying attention and my gms.com expired and got snapped up) . So thanks to all for the forgiveness that will be required for a bit when breaking some rule that I am not yet aware of. dont even know if this can be in the readme. lol.
